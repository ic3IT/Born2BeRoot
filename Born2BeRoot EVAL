    How a Virtual Machine Works:
        A virtual machine is like a computer inside your computer. It uses software to create a virtual environment that acts like a separate computer, allowing you to run different operating systems or apps in isolated spaces.

    Choice of Operating System:
        This depends on personal preference, requirements, and compatibility. Rocky is known for its stability and enterprise focus, while Debian is popular for its wide community support and vast package repository.

    Basic Differences Between Rocky and Debian:
        Rocky: Based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, focuses on stability and enterprise use.
        Debian: Community-driven, known for its large software repository and stability.

    Purpose of Virtual Machines:
        Virtual machines are used to run multiple operating systems on one physical machine, test software in safe environments, and efficiently use hardware resources.

    For Rocky - SELinux and DNF:
        SELinux: A security module in Linux that provides extra layers of security policies.
        DNF: A package manager for installing, updating, and managing software packages in Rocky.

    For Debian - Difference Between Aptitude and Apt, and What is AppArmor:
        Aptitude vs Apt: Both are package managers. Aptitude has a GUI and more features, while Apt is more straightforward and command-line based.
        AppArmor: A security module for Linux, similar to SELinux, that helps to limit the capabilities of programs.



    Simple Setup:
        Verify the virtual machine has no graphical environment at startup.
        Ensure connection is password-protected and not using the root user.
        Confirm UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) and SSH (Secure Shell) services are started.

    User:
        Check the presence of a user with the login of the student, in the "sudo" and "user42" groups.
        Test the password policy by creating a new user and assigning a compliant password.
        Have the student create a "evaluating" group and assign the new user to it.
        Discuss the advantages and implementation challenges of the password policy.

    Hostname and Partitions:
        Confirm the machine's hostname follows the format "login42".
        Change the hostname, restart the machine, and check the update.
        Ask about viewing partitions and compare with subject's example.
        Discuss LVM (Logical Volume Manager) basics and functionality.

    SUDO:
        Ensure "sudo" is installed and functioning.
        Add your new user to the "sudo" group.
        Discuss sudo's purpose and show implementation of the subject's rules.
        Check "/var/log/sudo/" for command history and test updating it with a new sudo command.

    UFW / Firewalld:
        Verify installation and operation of UFW (or Firewalld for Rocky).
        Understand UFW/Firewalld basics and importance.
        Review active rules, especially for port 4242.
        Add and then remove a rule for port 8080.

    SSH:
        Confirm SSH service installation and proper functioning.
        Discuss basic understanding of SSH and its use.
        Check that SSH operates only on port 4242.
        Test SSH login with the new user, ensuring root login is disabled.

    Script Monitoring:
        Have the student explain their script and how it operates.
        Learn what "cron" is and its role.
        Ensure the script is set to run every 10 minutes after server start.
        Modify to run every minute, then stop it without altering the script itself.
        Restart server and verify the script’s existence, permissions, and unaltered state.









    Check for Non-Graphical Environment:
        Upon VM startup, observe if it loads into a command-line interface (CLI) instead of a graphical user interface (GUI).

    Verify Operating System:
        For Rocky, enter cat /etc/redhat-release in the terminal.
        For Debian, use cat /etc/debian_version.

    SELinux, DNF, Aptitude, Apt, AppArmor:
        For Rocky:
            Check SELinux status: sestatus.
            Verify DNF: dnf --version.
        For Debian:
            Compare Aptitude and Apt: Check versions with aptitude --version and apt --version.
            Check AppArmor: sudo aa-status.

    Simple Setup Checks:
        Verify non-GUI startup: Observe interface on boot.
        Non-root login: Ensure you log in with a user account, not root.
        Check UFW/Firewalld and SSH:
            UFW (Debian): sudo ufw status.
            Firewalld (Rocky): sudo firewall-cmd --state.
            SSH: sudo systemctl status ssh.

    User Configuration Verification:
        Check existing user: id [username].
        Test password policy: Try setting a new password with passwd [newuser].
        Check groups: groups [newuser].
        Create and assign "evaluating" group: sudo groupadd evaluating and sudo usermod -aG evaluating [newuser].

    Hostname and Partitions:
        Confirm hostname: hostname.
        Change hostname: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname [newhostname], then reboot and check again.
        View partitions: Use lsblk or fdisk -l.
        Discuss LVM: Use lvdisplay or vgdisplay.

    SUDO Setup:
        Verify sudo: sudo -V.
        Add user to sudo: sudo usermod -aG sudo [newuser].
        Show sudo usage: Look at /etc/sudoers or demonstrate with sudo [command].
        Check log: cat /var/log/sudo/*.

    UFW / Firewalld:
        Check firewall status: UFW - sudo ufw status, Firewalld - sudo firewall-cmd --state.
        List rules: UFW - sudo ufw status numbered, Firewalld - sudo firewall-cmd --list-all.
        Add/remove rule: UFW - sudo ufw allow/deny 8080, Firewalld - sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent and sudo firewall-cmd --reload.

    SSH Configuration:
        Check SSH service: sudo systemctl status ssh.
        Verify port 4242: Check /etc/ssh/sshd_config for Port 4242.
        Test SSH login: ssh [newuser]@[IP-address] -p 4242.
        Ensure root login is disabled: In sshd_config, PermitRootLogin should be no.

    Script Monitoring:
        Have the student explain the script: Review the script code.
        Check cron setup: crontab -l for the student's cron jobs.
        Modify script timing: Edit the cron job with crontab -e.
        Restart and check: Restart the VM, then check the script’s status with ls -l [script path] and its settings in the cron job list.
